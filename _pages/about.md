<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My name is Qiyuan Chen (ÈôàÂêØÊ∫ê) and I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student at the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, co-supervised by [Prof. Jian Wu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0004274) and [Dr. Jintai Chen](https://whatashot.github.io/). Before that, I got my B.Sc. degree from the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Central China Normal University, under the guidance of [Prof. Bo Li](http://maths.ccnu.edu.cn/info/1040/18436.htm) and [Dr. Haitong Yang](http://cs.ccnu.edu.cn/info/1158/2237.htm).

My current research interests primarily include: **<span style="color:#8ECFC9">Machine Learning (ML)</span>**, **<span style="color:#82B0D2">Natural Language Processing (NLP)</span>** and **<span style="color:#FA7F6F">Multi Modal Learning (MM)</span>**. Specifically,

- Tabular Data Prediction and AutoML for Tabular Data
- Multi Modal Learning and its Applications in Medical
- Methods and Applications for Synthetic Data Generation
- Applications of LLMs (RAG, Agent, etc.) in Real-world Scenarios

**Feel free to contact me if your research lies within these or related areas!**

And I work really closely with [Qian Shao](https://abeier87.github.io/), [Hongsen Huang](https://github.com/SirlyDreamer) and [Zepeng Li](https://lzzppp.github.io/).

In my spare time, I really enjoy developing interesting websites and tools using FastAPI and Vue.js, and I'm also interested in DevOPS (CI/CD, container, etc.). If you're interested, check out my projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/qychen2001).

I also enjoy digital devices (mechanical keyboards, NAS, etc.), badminton, running and chess in my spare time.

## 2. [AInterview](https://github.com/qiyuan-chen/ChatInterview) (Team Lead, Main Contributor)

**You can check out the [DEMO](http://14.103.48.72/) here.**

This is a web-based tool that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to help job seekers **practice for interviews** using state-of-the-art technologies such as **RAG and Agent**.

As the team lead, I spearheaded both the **architectural design** and the development of backend algorithms.

**NOTE: Due to privacy considerations, this project will be fully open-sourced in the second half of 2024.**

## 3. [PyTorch Frame ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/pyg-team/pytorch-frame)](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch-frame) (Contributor)

Added additional model and dataset support for Pytorch Frame.
